# **Project Plan: Sudoku Solver from an Image**

## **1. Image Preprocessing (Computer Vision)**

**Objective:** Extract the Sudoku grid from the image and prepare it for digit recognition.

- **Steps:**
    - Convert the image to grayscale.
    - Apply adaptive thresholding to enhance contrast.
    - Detect edges using Canny Edge Detection.
    - Find the largest contour (assuming it's the Sudoku grid).
    - Apply a perspective transformation (warping) to get a straightened grid.

**Tools/Libraries:** OpenCV (Python)

---

## **2. Digit Recognition (Machine Learning Approach - CNN)**

**Objective:** Recognize the numbers in each cell of the Sudoku grid using ML.

### **Approach:**

‚úÖ **CNN-based Recognition (Deep Learning)**

- Train a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** on a dataset of Sudoku digits.
- Handles printed, handwritten, and distorted digits with high accuracy.
- Dataset: MNIST or a custom dataset of Sudoku images.

**Tools/Libraries:** OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras (CNN)

## **3. Sudoku Solver (Algorithmic Approach)**

**Objective:** Solve the extracted Sudoku puzzle.

### **Approach:**

‚úÖ **Backtracking Algorithm** ‚Äì A simple but effective brute-force search for a valid solution.

‚úÖ **Constraint Propagation** ‚Äì Uses logical rules to reduce the search space before backtracking.

üîπ *(Optional ML, but less efficient: ML-based solvers exist, but traditional algorithms outperform them for Sudoku solving.)*

**Tools/Libraries:** NumPy, Python

## **4. Solution Display**

**Objective:** Present the solved Sudoku puzzle in a structured digital format for easy readability.

### **Steps:**

1. Extract the Sudoku grid from the image.
2. Solve the puzzle using the implemented algorithm.
3. Display the solution in an interactive and structured format.

### **Approach:**

- Use a **web-based interface (Streamlit/Flask)** to show the solution as a table.
- Alternatively, implement a **GUI (Tkinter/PyQt)** for local display.
- Ensure the output is **clear, responsive, and user-friendly**.

**Tools/Libraries:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, Streamlit/Tkinter/PyQt

---

## **5. (Optional) User Interface for Input/Output**

**Objective:** Allow users to upload an image and get the solved Sudoku as output.

### **Options:**

- Command-line script
- Web app using Flask/Django
- GUI using Tkinter or Streamlit

---

## **6. (Optional) Handling Different Sudoku Sizes (ML-Based Approach for Scalability)**

**Objective:** Extend the solver to recognize and solve Sudoku puzzles of various sizes using ML.

### **Steps:**

1. **Detect Grid Size (ML-Based Classification)**
    - Train an ML model to classify Sudoku grid sizes (4√ó4, 6√ó6, 9√ó9, etc.).
    - Use CNN or Random Forest to recognize grid structures.
2. **Adjust Digit Recognition Model**
    - Extend CNN-based digit recognition to handle numbers beyond 1‚Äì9 (e.g., hexadecimal for 16√ó16 puzzles).
3. **Adapt Solver Algorithm**
    - Modify backtracking and constraint propagation to work for different grid sizes.
4. **Solution Overlay**
    - Scale and position numbers appropriately for each Sudoku variant.

**Tools/Libraries:** OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras (CNN), NumPy

## **Technologies to Use**

- **Python** (Main language)
- **OpenCV** (Image processing)
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (CNN for digit recognition & grid classification)
- **NumPy** (Data handling)
- **Flask/Streamlit** (Optional UI)
